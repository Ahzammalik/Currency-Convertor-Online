- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality works without internet connection
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic content loading to reduce initial page load

## Key Components

### Core JavaScript Classes
1. **CurrencyConverter**: Main application class handling all conversion logic
2. **API Management**: Handles multiple API endpoints with fallback mechanisms
3. **UI Controller**: Manages dynamic DOM manipulation and user interactions
4. **Cache Manager**: Handles local storage for currencies and exchange rates

### UI Components
1. **Main Converter**: Primary conversion interface with amount input and currency selectors
2. **Multiple Converters**: Dynamic addition of multiple conversion widgets
3. **Popular Rates Display**: Shows commonly used currency pairs
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API calls

## Data Flow

### Initial Load Process
1. Application initializes with default USD base currency
2. Currency list is loaded and cached locally
3. Exchange rates are fetched from primary API
4. UI components are populated with available currencies
5. Initial conversion is performed with default values

### Conversion Process
1. User inputs amount or selects different currencies
2. Application validates input and checks for cached rates
3. If rates are outdated, new API call is made
4. Conversion calculation is performed using live rates
5. Results are displayed with formatted currency values
6. Multiple converters update simultaneously if active

### Error Handling Flow
1. Primary API failure triggers fallback API attempt
2. If both APIs fail, cached rates are used with warning
3. Network errors show user-friendly messages
4. Invalid inputs are validated and corrected automatically
